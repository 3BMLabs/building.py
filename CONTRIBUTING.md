### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to BuildingPy? You can start by looking through the `beginner` and `help-wanted` tags in our issue tracker:

- **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

- **Create feature branches:** Don't ask us to pull from your main branch.
- **One pull request per feature:** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
