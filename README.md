# building.py
A Python library for creating buildings, building systems, objects, and exporting them to various programs such as Blender, Revit, and Speckle.

# Why?
In the realm of building design, almost everything can be categorized as a frame or a panel â€“ from windows and curtain walls to floor systems. The aim of the building.py project is to automate the creation of these systems.

Goals of the building.py Project:
* Develop a Python library for geometry creation without dependencies.
* Provide export options to:
  * Speckle
  * FreeCAD
  * Revit
  * XFEM4U
  * IFC using IFCOpenShell
  * Scia Engineer
 
# Design principles
* Create
