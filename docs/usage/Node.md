# Class `Node`
The `Node` class represents a geometric or structural node within a system, defined by a point in space, along with optional attributes like a direction vector, identifying number, and other characteristics.

## Constructor

### `__init__(self, point=None, vector=None, number=None, distance=0.0, diameter=None, comments=None)`
"Initializes a new Node instance.
        
        - `id` (str): A unique identifier for the node.
        - `type` (str): The class name, "Node".
        - `point` (Point, optional): The location of the node in 3D space.
        - `vector` (Vector, optional): A vector indicating the orientation or direction associated with the node.
        - `number` (any, optional): An identifying number or label for the node.
        - `distance` (float): A scalar attribute, potentially representing distance from a reference point or another node.
        - `diameter` (any, optional): A diameter associated with the node, useful in structural applications.
        - `comments` (str, optional): Additional comments or notes about the node.

## Methods

- `__str__(self) -> str`: Generates a string representation of the Node.

        

- `deserialize(data: dict) -> Node`: Recreates a Node object from a dictionary of serialized data.

        

- `merge(self)`: Merges this node with others in a project according to defined rules.

        The actual implementation of this method should consider merging nodes based on proximity or other criteria within the project context.
        

- `serialize(self) -> dict`: Serializes the node's attributes into a dictionary.

        This method allows for the node's properties to be easily stored or transmitted in a dictionary format.

        

- `snap(self)`: Adjusts the node's position based on snapping criteria.

        This could involve aligning the node to a grid, other nodes, or specific geometric entities.
        


## Documentation

#### `__str__(self) -> str`

Generates a string representation of the Node.

#### Returns:
`str`: A string that represents the Node, including its type and potentially other identifying information.


---

#### `deserialize(data: dict) -> Node`

Recreates a Node object from a dictionary of serialized data.

#### Parameters:
- data (dict): The dictionary containing the node's serialized data.

#### Returns:
`Node`: A new Node object initialized with the data from the dictionary.


---

#### `merge(self)`

Merges this node with others in a project according to defined rules.

The actual implementation of this method should consider merging nodes based on proximity or other criteria within the project context.


---

#### `serialize(self) -> dict`

Serializes the node's attributes into a dictionary.

This method allows for the node's properties to be easily stored or transmitted in a dictionary format.

#### Returns:
`dict`: A dictionary containing the serialized attributes of the node.


---

#### `snap(self)`

Adjusts the node's position based on snapping criteria.

This could involve aligning the node to a grid, other nodes, or specific geometric entities.
