# Class `Interval`
The `Interval` class is designed to represent a mathematical interval, providing a start and end value along with functionalities to handle intervals more comprehensively in various applications.

## Constructor

### `__init__(self, start: float, end: float)`
Initializes a new Interval instance.
        
        - `start` (float): The starting value of the interval.
        - `end` (float): The ending value of the interval.
        - `interval` (list, optional): A list that may represent subdivided intervals or specific points within the start and end bounds, depending on the context or method of subdivision.

## Methods

- `__str__(self) -> str`: Generates a string representation of the Interval.

        

- `deserialize(data: dict) -> Interval`: Reconstructs an Interval object from serialized data contained in a dictionary.

        

- `serialize(self) -> dict`: Serializes the interval's attributes into a dictionary.

        This method facilitates converting the interval's properties into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted.

        


## Documentation

#### `__str__(self) -> str`

Generates a string representation of the Interval.

#### Returns:
str: A string representation of the Interval, primarily indicating its class name.

#### Example usage:
```python

```

#### `deserialize(data: dict) -> Interval`

Reconstructs an Interval object from serialized data contained in a dictionary.

#### Parameters:
data (dict): The dictionary containing serialized data of an Interval object.

#### Returns:
Interval: A new Interval object initialized with the data from the dictionary.

#### Example usage:
```python

```

#### `serialize(self) -> dict`

Serializes the interval's attributes into a dictionary.

This method facilitates converting the interval's properties into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted.

#### Returns:
dict: A dictionary containing the serialized attributes of the interval.

#### Example usage:
```python

```
